Dynamic View Distance is a minecraft mod that makes the view distance dynamic to save resources. The current version is intended to be used only on the client. The mod increases the view/render distance when FPS are over 60 for 5 seconds and decreases it when FPS are under 30. These values currently are hard-coded and can't be changed. Soon there should be better configuration. Currently it is recommended to only uses this mod in singleplayer since it would refresh the world with every change of the view/render distance when on a server.
